# Instructions
For this assignment you will practice creating, examining, and combining different 
data structures in R. This assignment is different from others in that it takes a 
worksheet format with built-in error checking. Each time you complete an answer, if 
you knit the document it should check your answer (but don't remove "NULL" on an answer
before you want it checked or you'll get an error!) For this reason, you should re-knit
every time you answer a question, so that if something goes wrong, you know the last edit
caused the issue!

You will need to do the following:

1) Fill in **code** as needed in the designated locations in code chunks.
    + You will not need to create new code chunks or edit chunk options.
    + Instructions in chunks will be shown as comments (after `#`); *remove* and *replace* the comments with your code:
    + Where you are assigning things to objects, replace the "NULL" values with your code. See code example 1 for an example!
    + You may need to add elements, such as for subsetting, to objects on the left side of operators. See code example 2 for an example!
    + Some answers may require multiple lines of code, so add as necessary.
    + Do not modify chunks labeled with "`# DO NOT EDIT`"; these are used to test your code.
2) Fill in **text** as block quotes (use `>`) in designated locations to answer questions.
    + Be brief and specific. If you reference a single value or short (<10 element) vector, use in-line R code. If the answer can be clearly and
    accurately answered without referencing any values, you can do so. When I bold a word in a question, take it to mean I want you to reference a value or values.
    + Do not directly reference matrices, lists, or data frames in text (don't display them). They can be big!
    + You should not *need* to include any code *chunks* in this section, but you can if you need.

**Example for Code Questions:**
```{r example_1}
# Ex 1) Create a vector of the numbers 1, 5, 3, 2, 4.
example <- NULL
# You would write this:
example <- c(1,5,3,2,4)

# Ex 2) Add the number 10 to the sixth position of example2
example2 <- example
example2 <- NULL

# You would write:
example2[6] <- 10
```


**Example for Text Questions:**
 1) "How do atomic vectors differ from lists?"
 
> An atomic vector is a one dimensional object where every element is the same type of data.
> Lists are one dimensional but elements can be different data types.

# Problems

## 1: Coding with (Atomic) Vectors
```{r vectors_1}
# 1) Use "seq()" to create a vector of 10 numbers evenly spaced from 0 to 15.
vec_num <- seq(0,15, length.out = 10)

# 2) Use ":" to create an integer vector of the numbers 11 through 20.
vec_int <- c(11:20)

# 3) Use "LETTERS" and "[ ]" to create a vector of the last 10 capital letters.
vec_cha <- tail(LETTERS,10)

# 4) Use letters and "[ ]" to create a factor variable using the first ten lower case letters.
vec_fac <- factor(letters[1:10])

# 5) Use "c()" to combine "vec_cha" and "vec_fac" into "vec_let". Do not convert it to a factor!
vec_let <- c(vec_cha, vec_fac)

# 6) Use "c()" and "[ ]" to combine the first 4 elements of "vec_num" with the last
# 4 elements of "vec_int" to create "vec_ni".
vec_ni <- c(vec_num[1:4], vec_int[7:10])

# 7) Use "rev()" to reverse the order of "vec_fac".
fac_vec <- rev(vec_fac)

```
*How'd you do?*
```{r vectors_1_check, echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, collapse=TRUE, comment=''}
# DO NOT EDIT ANY PART OF THIS CHUNK
test_x(vec_num, class="numeric",   dims=10, c_pos=4, c_val=5)
test_x(vec_int, class="integer",   dims=10, c_pos=5,  c_val=15)
test_x(vec_cha, class="character", dims=10, c_pos=3,  c_val="S")
test_x(vec_fac, class="factor",    dims=10, c_pos=7,  c_val="g")
test_x(vec_let, class="character", dims=20, c_pos=19, c_val="9")
test_x(vec_ni,  class="numeric",   dims=8,  c_pos=5,  c_val=17)
test_x(fac_vec, class="factor", dims=10, c_pos=4, c_val="g")
```

### Questions about Vectors: 

1) If you used `c()` to combine `vec_int` with `vec_fac`, what *class* of vector would you get? Why?

> You'd end up with character as the class for the vector. This is because `r` prefers a vector 
> with elements of the same type. Converting to an integer or numeric would end up deleting data 
> so it turns the numbers into characters.

2) Consider this code: 
```{r vectors_2, echo=TRUE}
new_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) 

```
   + What **class** of vector is this?
   
   > This is a logical vector
   
   + In words, what happens to its values when you try to convert it to numeric? To character? To numeric and then character?
   
   > Converting to numeric would change the TRUEs and FALSEs to ones and zeros.
   > Converting to character would change them into the words "TRUE" and "FALSE".
   > Converting to numeric then character would create a vector of the charaters "1" and "0" respectively
   
   + What about to character and then numeric?
   
   > No way. You get `NA`s
   
  
## 2: Coding with Matrices
```{r matrices_1}
# 1) Use matrix() to create a matrix with 10 rows and four columns filled with NA
mat_empty <- matrix(NA, nrow = 10, ncol = 4)

# 2) Assign "vec_num" to the first column of "mat_1" below.
mat_1 <- mat_empty # DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE; add code below it.
mat_1[,1] <- vec_num

# 3) Assign "vec_int" to the second column of "mat_2" below
mat_2 <- mat_1 # DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE; add code below it.
mat_2[,2] <- vec_int

# 4) Assign "vec_cha" and "vec_fac" to the third and fourth columns of "mat_3" using one assignment operator.
mat_3 <- mat_2 # DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE; add code below it.
mat_3[,3:4] <- c(vec_cha, vec_fac)

# 5) Select the fourth row from "mat_3" and assign it to the object "row_4" as a vector.
row_4 <- mat_3[4,]

# 6) Assign the element in the 6th row and 2nd column of "mat_3" to "val_6_2" as a numeric value.
val_6_2 <- as.numeric(mat_3[6,2])

# 7) Use "cbind()" to combine "vec_num", "vec_int", "vec_cha", and "vec_fac" into "mat_4".
mat_4 <- cbind(vec_num, vec_int, vec_cha, vec_fac)

# 8) Next, first transpose mat_4, then select only the first four columns and assign to mat_t
mat_t <- t(mat_4)[,1:4]

# 9)  Then use rbind() to add the rows from mat_3 to this (mat_t first, mat_3 second) and assign this combination to mat_big.
mat_big <- rbind(mat_t, mat_3[1:10,])

```

*How'd you do?*
```{r matrices_1_test, echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, collapse=TRUE, comment=''}
# DO NOT EDIT ANY PART OF THIS CHUNK
test_x(mat_empty, class="matrix", dims=c(10,4), all_NA=TRUE)
test_x(mat_1, class="matrix", dims=c(10,4), numeric=TRUE, na_check=1)
test_x(mat_2, class="matrix", dims=c(10,4), numeric=TRUE, na_check=2)
test_x(mat_3, class="matrix", dims=c(10,4), numeric=FALSE, na_check=3, c_pos=c(2,3), c_val="R")
test_x(row_4, class="character", dims=4, numeric=FALSE, na_check=1, c_pos=2, c_val=14)
test_x(val_6_2, class="numeric", dims=1, numeric=TRUE, na_check=1, c_pos=1, c_val=16)
test_x(mat_4, class="matrix", dims=c(10,4), numeric=FALSE, na_check=3, c_pos=c(5,3), c_val="U")
test_x(mat_t, class="matrix", dims=c(4,4), numeric=FALSE, na_check=2, c_pos=c(2,2), c_val="12")
test_x(mat_big, class="matrix", dims=c(14,4), numeric=FALSE, na_check=3, c_pos=c(2,3), c_val="13")
```

### Questions about Matrices: 

1) Note the column names on mat_4. What do you get when you try to get `names()` from `mat_4`?
What about `colnames()`? What about `rownames()`? Can you guess why you get all these results?

> I'm assuming because the matrix hasn't been assigned labels for its rows yet. As of now, the 
> words that appear on the rows are an index and the names that appear as the column headers are the names 
> of the vectors. Since a dataframe is a list, you can use `names()` on it, but `mat_4` is a matrix and as 
> such the `names()` funtion doesn't work on it.

2) Consider the code below:
```{r matrices_2, echo=TRUE}
mat_letters <- matrix(letters, ncol=2) 
```

   + This matrix goes from `"a"` to `"m"` in the first column and `"n"` to `"z"` in the second. 
    What would be an easty way to make the matrix go in alphabetical order left to right, top to bottom?
    
    > To transpose it using the `t()` function.

3) Consider the code below:
```{r matrices_3, echo=TRUE}
math_mat <- matrix(1:5, nrow=5, ncol=5)
math_vec <- 1:5
```

   + Without showing your code (use the console), look at `math_mat` and `math_vec`. When you add `math_mat + math_vec`, what happens?
   
   > It goes element by element down the second matrix and adds each element of the first matrix to it
   > top to bottom down each column from left to right
   
   + Without showing your code (use the console), what is the difference between the results from `math_mat %*% math_vec` and from `math_mat * math_vec`. Can you tell what is happening?
   
   > This is doing the same thing as above, yet instead of adding element by element, it is multiplying
   > importantly it seems to be doing this by position matching within vector.
   
## 3: Lists
```{r lists_1}
# 1) Use "list()" to create a list that contains "vec_num" and "row_4", and assign the names
#   "vec_num" and "row_4" to these two elements of "list_1".
list_1 <- list("vec_num" = vec_num, "row_4" = row_4)

# 2) Using "$", extract "row_4" from "list_1" and assign it to the object "row_4_2".
row_4_2 <- list_1$row_4

# 3) Create another list that contains "val_6_2" and "mat_big".
list_2 <- list(val_6_2, mat_big)

# 4) Combine list_1 and list_2 together using "c()" and assign them to "list_3"
list_3 <- c(list_1, list_2)

# 5) Use "unlist()" to turn "list_3" into a vector and assign it to "vector_3"
vector_3 <- unlist(list_3)

# 6) Use "as.list()" to convert "vector_3" into a list and assign it to "list_big"
list_big <- as.list(vector_3)

# 7) Now copy "list_3" as "list_4" and use "[[ ]]" to assign "list_3" as the last (fifth) element of "list_4";
# that is, you should have a list object with five elements named "list_4" that contains the same four
# elements as "list_3" plus a fifth element that is -all- four elements of "list_3" as one object.
list_4 <- c(list_3[1], list_3[2], list_3[3], list_3[4])
list_4[[5]] <- list_3
# 8) Select the third element (that is, the sub-element) of the the fifth element of "list_4" and assign it 
# to element_5_3 using "[[ ]]".
element_5_3 <- list_4[[5]][[3]]

# 9) Lastly, repeat the previous assignment of the third element of the fifth element, but
# extract the element as a list rather than scalar using "[ ]" and assign it to "list_5_3".
list_5_3 <- list_4[[5]][3]
```

*How'd you do?*
```{r lists_1_test, echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, collapse=TRUE, comment=''}
# DO NOT EDIT ANY PART OF THIS CHUNK
test_x(list_1, class="list", dims=2, na_check=2, c_pos=c(2,3), c_val="T", nam_pos = 2, nam_val="row_4")
test_x(row_4_2, dim=4, c_pos=2, c_val="14")
test_x(list_2, class="list", dims=2, na_check=2, c_pos=c(2,16), c_val=12)
test_x(list_3, class="list", dims=4, na_check=2, c_pos=c(4,3), c_val="Q")
test_x(vector_3, class="character", dims=71, c_pos=29, c_val="15")
test_x(list_big, class="list", dims=71, c_pos=29, c_val="15")
test_x(list_4, class="list", dims=5, c_pos=c(5,4,17), c_val="R")
test_x(element_5_3, class="numeric", dims=1, c_pos=1, c_val=16)
test_x(list_5_3, class="list", dims=1, c_pos=c(1,1), c_val=16)
```

### Questions About Lists: 
Many functions in R produce lists as output because they produce objects with 
different types of data and of different lengths. For instance, consider the linear
regression saved to `lm.output` below. Don't worry if you are not familiar with 
regression, we're just concerned with what the function produces!

```{r lm, echo=TRUE}
lm.output <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars)
lm.output
```
1) **How many elements** does this call to `lm()` produce?

> 12

2) What are the **dimensions** of the `model` element?

> 2?

3) What are the **values** of the `coefficients` for the `intercept` and `wt`? Remember
to call on them from `lm.output` object for your answer!

> `r lm.output$coefficients`


## 4: Coding with Data Frames
```{r data_frames_1}
# 1) Use "data.frame()" to combine "vec_num" (first column) and "vec_int" (second column) into "df_1".
df_1 <- data.frame(vec_num, vec_int)

# 2) Use "$" to extract "vec_num" from "df_1", reverse it with "rev()", and assign it as the vector "vec_num_2".
vec_num_2 <- rev(df_1$vec_num)

# 3) Use "$" to add "vec_num_2" to "df_2" as a new column with the name "number_vector".
df_2 <- df_1 # DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE; add code below it.
df_2$number_vector <- vec_num_2

# 4) Combine "df_2" with itself using "rbind()" to create "df_3"
df_3 <- rbind(df_2, df_2)

# 5) Create a new data frame "df_4" using "data.frame()" that contains the following named columns (in order):
    # "y" that contains 20 numbers evenly spaced from 31 to 125
    # "x" that has 20 numbers between 0 and 10 generated using "runif()" (get help with ?runif)
    # "color" that consists of 20 values sampled from "col_vec "below using "sample()".
col_vec <- colors() # DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE; add code below it.
df_4 <- data.frame("y" = seq(31, 125, length.out = 20), "x" = runif(20, min = 0, max = 10), "color" = sample(col_vec, 20))

    # This code here should produce a plot of those values with those colors!
if(is.null(df_4)==FALSE) df_4 %>% ggplot(aes(x, y, color=color)) + geom_point() + theme(legend.position="none")

# 5) Use "cbind()" to combine "df_4" and "df_2" into "df_5".
df_5 <- cbind(df_4, df_2)

# 6) Now use "data.frame()" to combine "df_4" with "df_2"
df_6 <- data.frame(df_4, df_2)

```

*How'd you do?*
```{r data_frames_1_test, echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, collapse=TRUE, comment=''}
# DO NOT EDIT ANY PART OF THIS CHUNK
test_x(df_1, class="data.frame", dims=c(10,2), c_pos=c(3,2), c_val=13)
test_x(vec_num_2, class="numeric", dims=10, c_pos=10, c_val=0)
test_x(df_2, class="data.frame", dims=c(10,3), c_pos=c(1,3), c_val=15, nam_pos=3, nam_val="number_vector")
test_x(df_3, class="data.frame", dims=c(20,3), c_pos=c(11,3), c_val=15)
test_x(df_4, class="data.frame", dims=c(20,3), c_pos=c(13,3), c_val="deeppink4", nam_pos=2, nam_val="x")
test_x(df_5, class="data.frame", dims=c(20,6), nam_pos=5, nam_val="vec_int")
test_x(df_6, class="data.frame", dims=c(20,6), nam_pos=4, nam_val="vec_num")
```

### Questions About Data Frames: 
1) First, let's add `vec_cha` to df_1 to make a new data frame and then use `lapply(df_cha, class)` to get a list that indicates the class of each column in `df_1` (you'll need to run this yourself in the console or turn eval=TRUE):

```{r data_frames_2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
df_cha <- data.frame(df_1, vec_cha)
lapply(df_cha, class)
```

Do you see anything unusual about `df_cha$vec_cha`, say if we get `class(vec_cha)`? Get help on data frames with
`?data.frame` and explain in a sentence what you could do to modify this behavior.

> You could reassign the object within the dataframe by calling the object with $vec_cha
> then applying the function as.character()

2) Use `names()`, `colnames()`, and `rownames()` on df_1. How does this compare to the behavior
of these functions on lists and matrices?

> These three ways of storing data all have different properties. Names() will tell you 
> the names of vector or objects. Since a dataframe is just several vectors strung
> together you get the names of the columns, which is what you'll get too if you use the
> function colnames(). rownames() refer to the labels of the rows. In a dataframe these
> are automatically numerically indexed, in a list these don't exist since a list is a one
> dimensional gathering of objects, and in a matrix this will call nothing if the rows
> haven't been named beforehand. Colnames() functions the same in a list, dataframe, and
> matrix as rownames()

3) Similarly, how do the results of `length()` and `dim()` differ between data frames,
lists, matrices, and vectors?

> length() performs the following functions: With matrices it counts the elements across
> all dimensions

4) Using the console, use `==` to test to see if `cbind()` and `data.frame()` in questions 5 and 6 produce the same result. Optional: If you want to make this cleaner, integrate either `all()` or `any()` functions, which could allow you to show this result in-line in your answer.

> They do not. It seems that the attending dataframes need to be of the same length

5) As a final question, which won't be graded strictly, use between three sentences and a paragraph to 
describe the differences and similarities between (this is mainly to help you think them through!):

Vectors and lists.
> A vector is a collection of elements that are indexed by their position, while a list is a series of elements that can be lists, dataframes, objects, vectors, etc.

Data frames and matrices
> Dataframes are aggregated vectors, each column is a unique vector and each row is its own "case". Matrices are more like spreadsheets where data is indexed along two dimensions. Because of these differences calling and storing data are performed differently.

Lists and data frames.
> Dataframes are similar to lists in that they represent a collection of some object however in the case of lists the type of object that can be "stored" is not restricted to vectors of equal length.

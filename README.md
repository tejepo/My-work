Storage space for my code

The purpose of this repository is to catalogue the various files I've made over my graduate career while learning how to code for my own research but also for various files. The order is non-specific and the dates are a part of the meta-data. This is less of a storage or organizational tool and more of a way for me to look back in 5 years and marvel at how bad my code was.
